# MTBoost: Reinforcement Learning for Robust DNN Classifiers

MTBoost is a reinforcement learningâ€“based algorithm designed to improve the **robustness** of deep neural network (DNN) classifiers, evaluated through **metamorphic relations (MRs)**.  

## ðŸš€ Introduction  

Traditional metrics like **accuracy** measure how often a DNN predicts the correct label:  

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \Pr\{F(x) = y\}
\]  

However, accuracy alone does not capture **robustness**. Robustness refers to whether a DNN produces consistent predictions under transformations that should not change the label (e.g., image rotation).  

We define robustness using metamorphic relations (MRs), such as:  

\[
F(x) = F(x') \quad \text{where } x' = T(x)
\]  

MTBoost improves robustness **without sacrificing accuracy** by optimizing three objectives:  

1. Maximize \(\Pr\{F(x) = y\}\)  
2. Maximize \(\Pr\{F(x') = y\}\)  
3. Maximize \(\Pr\{f(x) = f(x')\}\)  

where \(F(x)\) is the predicted label and \(f(x)\) is the raw output (logits).  

## âœ¨ Features  

- Reinforcement learningâ€“based training algorithm  
- Robustness evaluation using metamorphic relations (MRs)  
- Custom loss function with regularization:  

\[
\text{Loss} = \text{loss}_1 + \alpha \cdot \text{loss}_2 + \beta \cdot \text{loss}_3
\]  

- Applicable to image classification tasks and beyond
