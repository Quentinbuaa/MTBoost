# MTBoost: A Reinforcement-Learning-based Training Method for Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Neural Network Classifiers

## ðŸš€ Introduction
Traditional metrics like **accuracy** measure how often a DNN predicts the correct label:  

`
Accuracy = Pr{F(x) = y}
`

However, accuracy alone does not capture **robustness**. Robustness refers to whether a DNN produces consistent predictions under transformations that should not change the label (e.g., image rotation).  

Robustness can be evaluated with metamorphic relations (MRs), such as:  

``
F(x) = F(x') where  x' = T(x;Î¸), a transformation with x.
``


MTBoost improves robustness **without sacrificing accuracy** by optimizing three objectives:  

1. Maximize `Pr{F(x) = y}`  
2. Maximize `Pr{F(x') = y}`  
3. Maximize `Pr{f(x) = f(x')}`  

where `F(x)` is the predicted label and `f(x)` is the raw output (logits).  

## âœ¨ Features  

- Custom loss function with regularization:

``
Loss = loss1 +  Î±Â·loss2 + Î²Â·loss3, where, if loss1 = cross_entropy(F(x), y), loss2=cross_entropy(F(x'), y), and loss3=KLDivLoss(f(x'), f(x))
``

- Reinforcement learningâ€“based training algorithm is designed to select `x'=T(x;Î¸)` after each train epoch.
